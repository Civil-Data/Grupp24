According to \cite{anily1992swapping}, 'Even the simple swapping problem is NP-hard.' As shown in Section 2.2, the problem at hand can be considered a swapping problem. Due to the nature of NP-hard problems, brute-forcing a solution is not a viable option. The search space is large and only grows with the number of 
floors and people in the elevator, which also contributes to many local minima and maxima. The problem we are dealing with is to be considered a real-world
scenario where finding the most optimal solution is not necessarily required; instead, the priority is to reach an acceptable solution within a reasonable 
amount of time. Therefore, the choice of a genetic algorithm was made. By using a population of genes, a good coverage of the search space is achieved.
By using a mutation rate and smart selection algorithms, the algorithm can escape local minima and maxima. Ultimately,
the most important aspect is reaching a solution in a reasonable amount of time and the solution does not need to be the optimal.
