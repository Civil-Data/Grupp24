This report addresses an investigation for optimizing an elevators route to improve the efficiency of picking up and delivering passengers to their desired floors.
In large buildings with a lot of floors, efficient elevators are crucial for managing traffic and must serve everyone in a reasonable time.
Poorly designed elevator systems will lead to long waiting time, unnecessary stops and unsatisfied users.
Elevator technology have made progress during the years, but many elevators still struggle with finding an efficient way
to serve passengers.

The hypotheses that evolutionary algorithms will be able to find near-optimal or optimal routes for elevators
aiming to maximize the number of passengers served while minimizing travel distance and travel time is
the core focus in the report. Different strategies and hyperparameters are experimented with to enable
demonstration of how evolutionary algorithms can be used in such a problem.

This paper will focus on a statically defined problem, i.e., there will not be more passengers coming to the elevator as time goes on, unlike a normal elevator.
