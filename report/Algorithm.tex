\subsection{Evolutionary approach}
% Clearly describe the algorithm you developed. You
% should clearly explain the evolutionary operators you used and what modifications
% you did to match the problem. It is extremely important to present also a pseudo code
% of your algorithm.

The genetic algorithm implemented in this study is based on the framework presented in a relatively recent paper \cite{tartan2016flow}, which explored a similar problem. The details of the implemented genetic algorithm can be found in \ref{alg:pseudocode_ga}. A key difference in this paper is the absence of a termination criterion; instead, the algorithm is set to execute for a specified number of generations. The flowchart illustrating the original framework is shown in Figure \ref{fig:flowchart}.

\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{Genetic Algorithm}\label{alg:pseudocode_ga}

		\State Breed two children using a crossover operator
		\Else
		\State Select the two parents as the two new children
		\EndIf
		\For{\text{each child}}
		\If{the mutation chance is fulfilled}
		\State Apply a mutation operator
		\EndIf
		\EndFor
		\State Append the two children to the next population
		\EndWhile

\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Selection}
% Explain selection algorithm(s)

The chosen selection algorithm is rank-based selection, and the basic principle behind it is to choose two parents based on their ranks rather than their raw fitness values. For example, if the population consists of six chromosome, the best chromosome is given rank six, the second best rank five and so on. The worst chromosome is given rank one. Each chromosome is then given a probability $ P_i $ to be chosen based on their respective ranks, expressed as:

$$ P_i = \frac{\text{rank}_i}{\sum \text{ranks}} $$

That is, the best chromosome would have a probability of $ P_6 = \frac{6}{21} $ to be chosen, the second best $ P_5 = \frac{5}{21} $, and the worst chromosome $ P_1 = \frac{1}{21} $.

\subsubsection{Crossover}
% Explain crossover algorithm(s)
\begin{par}
	The first basic crossover operator is one that simply swaps the last halves of the parents, while respecting the possibility that the two parents may be of different length. For example, if the two parents are
	\[
		[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
	\]
	the resulting children would be
	\[
		[1, 2, 8, 9, 10], [5, 6, 7, 1, 2]
	\]
	\label{par:swap last halves}
\end{par}

\subsubsection{Mutation}
% Explain mutation algorithm(s)
\label{subsubsec:mutation}

Three basic mutation operators were implemented. Firstly, a swap mutation where two randomly chosen floors are swapped. Secondly, an operator which increases the length of the chromosome by appending a random floor at the end. Lastly, an operator that decreases the length by removing a randomly chosen index of the chromosome. With these three operators, an additional two operators were constructed by combining the effects of swap and either length operator.

% \subsubsection{Replacement} % Elitism
% We never used elitism in the experiments?

\subsection{Solution representation}
% Clearly describe the solution representation you used.
% You can use figures to improve the comprehensibility of this part.

Given the nature of this problem, there is not a typical direct solution representation approach as seen in e.g. the knapsack problem, where the solution representation is also directly what is being manipulated in the genetic algorithm. In this paper's elevator problem, the chromosome is a sequence of floors in which the elevator travels to with the goal to deliver as many people as possible. This situation forced a 'two-way' representation, where the fitness of a chromosome is reflected upon a list of people. Thus, it was decided to encapsulate the list of floors and the list of people under a single object 'Chromosome' as the solution representation.

\subsection{Fitness function}
\label{subsec:fitness_function}
% It is also very important to mention the fitness function you
% used. In many cases, the objective function of the problem is not the same as
% the fitness function used in an evolutionary algorithm

After some basic trial and error, and more importantly, a healthy discussion with the assignment teacher, it was decided to exclusively punish unwanted behavior of the chromosome instead of giving rewards or mixing rewards with punishments. As the ultimate goal of the algorithm is to deliver all passengers in a short average time, a punishment-only approach acts like a 'catch-all' sink. Instead of trying to find and giving rewards for all the different kinds of positive behaviors, it is instead easier to punish any and all negative behaviors. For example, if a passenger wants to travel from floor five to one, that requires an absolute minimum of four floors worth of travel. The implemented fitness function would in that case punish based on the difference in distance needed and the distance that was actually traveled by the passenger. Another simple example would be to punish the chromosome for everyone that did not arrive at their destinations, rather than rewarding for those that did arrive.
