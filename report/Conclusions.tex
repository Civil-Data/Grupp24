The paper mainly looked at different crossover functions impact on our genetic algoritmes abilty to find solutions for various buildings configurations. For the statistics the conclusions drawn are: 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
	\hline
	Building & Crossover function \\ \hline
	1 & Vilken som var bäst \\ \hline
	2 & Vilken som var bäst \\ \hline
	3 & Vilken som var bäst \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Because the algorithm is not forced to find a solution where all people reach their destination floor, our implementations include a time penalty discussed in (3.x), this to incentivize the algorithm to deliver all people to there destion floor. Further research on the impact of this time penalty in relation to the number of people in the building and their configurations and configuerations .

A finding from the paper is that a higher mutation rate seems to be better. To deturmen this further research in this area is needed. Is a higher mutation rate better? If so, what is the optimal range?

In addition, this report does not focus on the selection algorithm for the problem. Further research on which selection algorithm will perform best for the problem at hand would be of interest.
